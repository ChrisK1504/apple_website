# Project Name: Mockup Iphone Website

## Description
This is strictly a frontend built to replicate the original Iphone website closely. It includes a Hero section, Navbar, Highlights as well as a Video Carousel. On the future I plan on
adding a 3D model of the Iphone using Three.js. The layout of the website is dynamic and changes based on screen size, so it can be viewed easily on any screen and device.

## Technologies
React.js was used for the building of the website, while following common standard practices. The project was initialized using Vite, as is the modern practice.
Tailwind CSS was used for the stylizing of the components.
